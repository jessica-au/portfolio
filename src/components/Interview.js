            So Jessica, you're interviewing yourself for prospective employers?

            Yep.  Looks like it.

            Pretty cool.  So tell me a bit about yourself.  

            Well Jessica, it's been a non-linear path to software engineering.  I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in, get this, English.  And a few years later, I attended CSUS for a single subject teaching credential in English.  I taught within the public education system for some years before switching to the private sector.  
            
            Sounds like you've seen a lot within the educational sphere! What made you decide to change paths? 
            
            COVID hit. I had time to consider my path, pursue passion interests, and it kind of snowballed from there.  I have a great passion for learning and for languages!  Quarantine and shelter-in-place allowed me to do a deep dive into linguistics, which kind of naturally led to programmatic languages, and before I knew it, I was finishing up a Software Engineering Immersive Program through General Assembly!
